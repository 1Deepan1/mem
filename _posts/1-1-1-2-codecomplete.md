## Notes From Code Complete ##

This could be usefull if you had read Code Complete by Steve.

---

### Steve's Point of View ###
1. Source Code is the only long lasting accurate description of software
2. Software construction is the only activity thats gauranteed to be done
3. Great Softwares are cerated thorugh the thoursands of tiny decisions,desgin,comments and so on.
4. Construct the software well the first time , you wont get a chance to do it again.
5. Leave the code more pristine than it was.

###Complexity 
1. Main reason for project failure is requiremts 
2. Second reason is poor project planning
3. Third reason - code quality

---

###Manage Complexity
1. Divide program into manageable size chunks, chunks should be isolated safely to ignore other chunks
2. Stay away from accidental complexity 

---

###Tools for dealing with Complexity
1. Abstraction
2. Cohession / single responsibility
3. Encapsulation
4. Hierarchies
5. Seperation of concerns
6. Coding Conventions
7. Deep Nesting - avoid more than 3 nesting levels
8. Avoid global data
9. Go for the simplest design
10. Quality interfaces
11. Read time vs write time - Code is read many times than it is written
