>Experience is making mistakes and learning from them.

- Also the other most important aspect is learing from others experience. There are lots of resources available out there, books written by experts who have more than 20 years of experience, Code Complete by Steve, Refactoring by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler, Youtube videos from university professors and many more that a Software Developer should never miss.
- I am trying to aggregate, add notes and references to those resources in this repositroy , so everyone can benefit from it. More importantly, I dont want to forget what I read.
