### Functional Dependencies
- It's a tool for normalization
- Given a relation R, a set of attributes X in R is said to functionally determine another set of attributes Y, also in R, (written X → Y) if, and only if, each X value in R is associated with precisely one Y value in R; R is then said to satisfy the functional dependency X → Y.
- a is funtionally dependent on b , if given a , you should be able to find b.
- eg: say if state name is given , you will be able to find the country it belongs. But vice vera is not possible. 
- eg: Employee ID → Employee Name
