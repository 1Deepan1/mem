### User Stories

- How many times , have you been given a job where you dont understand the reason you're doing it.

```
After finishing the dinner ,
 I went for washing my hands before I left the table,
 my mom asked me to get a plate, she haven’t started 
 with her dinner yet, usually here in India, 
 mom first serves and once she is sure that everybody is full ,
 then she takes her turn.  Within a minute I came with a plate 
 assuming she is yet to eat. And she says, 
 “How can I use it to cover the bowl” 
 Okay , the story is over , 
 lets get into the character now.
```
