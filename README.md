A Jekyll-based framework for creating presentations based on Reveal.js and markdown. 
Forked from http://dploeger.github.io/jekyll-revealjs/ 

### Vision

**Experience is making mistakes and learning from them.**

Every one will agree to it, also the other most important aspect of experience is learing from others experience. 
There are lots of resources available out there , books written by experts who have more than 20 years of experience , say code complete by Steve , Refactoring by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler , youtube videos from university professors and many more that a Software Developer should never miss. 

I am trying to aggregate , add notes and references to those resources in this repositroy , so everyone can benefit from it.
Feel free to use https://1deepan1.github.io/mem for sharing / learning .

If anyone wants to remove the contents - which should'nt be in here - please write a mail to me.

Feel free to contribute your learnings.
